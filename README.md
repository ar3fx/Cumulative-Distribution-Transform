# Cumulative-Distribution-Transform

This is an implementation of our recent paper:

''Park SR, Kolouri S, Kundu S, Rohde GK. The cumulative distribution transform and linear pattern classification. Applied and Computational Harmonic Analysis. 2017 Feb 22.''

The iPython notebook file "CDT_Notebook.ipynb" contains the succinct formulation and demo of the transformation.
